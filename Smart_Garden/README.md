## Description  
SmartGarden is a Cisco Packet Tracer simulation project that demonstrates how IoT can automate irrigation systems in a smart farming environment.  

The setup includes a wireless router, an IoT server (configured with a static IP), a client device, and IoT components such as a **water level monitor** and a **lawn sprinkler** connected via DHCP.  

The IoT server monitors the water level and automatically triggers the sprinkler when the soil moisture or water level drops below a defined threshold. This simulation showcases how IoT technology can help optimize water usage and support sustainable agriculture practices.  

## Inspiration  
This project was inspired by [TechSkillBuilderâ€™s YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdeXrsMFnq4), which introduced me to the fundamentals of IoT automation and smart farming concepts.
