# ðŸ’¡ IoT Projects

Welcome to my collection of IoT simulation projects!  

This repository contains various projects that explore the fundamentals of the Internet of Things (IoT), automation, sensors, and smart technology applications. Each project is organized in its own folder with a detailed README and related simulation files.  

Projects include smart farming systems, home automation simulations, and other IoT experiments built using Cisco Packet Tracer and similar tools.  

Explore each folder to see the project setup, technical details, and inspiration behind the simulations.
